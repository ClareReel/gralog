look for plugin installation guide (not extensive tbh)

This project's goal is to create a plugin for the software "GrALoG" which, when used, visualises step-by-step the process of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on a network graph.

Months 1-2: Preparation and Drafting
Weeks 1-4: - Familiarise with GrALoG software; understand requirements and limitations. - Set up workspace. - Deconstruct Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, understand how it can be represented using GrALoG. - Rough draft of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in Java.
Weeks 5-8: - Implement the core Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in full within GrALoG.

Months 3-4: Integration and Visualisation
Weeks 9-12: - Implement detailed logging in order for the algorithm to report its state at every step. - Include unit tests to ensure that the algorithm calculates the max flow correctly. - Ensure visualisation of residual graph using updated edge capacities.
Weeks 13-16: - Modify code to support pausing and stepping with supported visualisation. - Implement the controls: Start, Pause, Step Forward, Step Backward, Clear. - Test code with a wide variety of complex graphs. - Implement error handling and user feedback for invalid inputs. - Debug. - Ensure functionality across operating systems.

Months 5-6: Documentation and Handover
Weeks 17-18: Development Report - Write up majority of report of production.
Weeks 19-20:Plugin Guide - Write the plugin installation guide. - Ensure inclusion of other major operating systems. - Write algorithm and visualiser guide.
Weeks 21-24: Finalize All Documentation - Finalise report of production. - Finalise plugin installation guide. - Finalise algorithm and visualiser guide. - Clean code and package nicely for assessment. - Record a final demo video showcasing features. - Deliver: final code repository, report, installation guide, algorithm guide, and demo video.
